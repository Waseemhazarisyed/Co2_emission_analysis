# CO2 Emissions Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global CO2 emissions data to uncover trends over time and across countries. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and an interactive dashboard built using Plotly.

## Problem Statement
Understanding global and country-level CO2 emission patterns helps identify major contributors and monitor progress toward climate goals.

## Dataset
The dataset contains yearly CO2 emission data by country from [insert data source here]. It includes columns for Country, Year, and CO2 Emissions (in tonnes).

## What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data.
- Performed EDA with visualizations of trends and top emitters.
- Created an interactive dashboard with:
  - Global emissions trend over years.
  - Top 10 CO2 emitting countries.
  - Country-wise emission trends with interactivity.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a Python environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Open the Jupyter notebook CO2_Emissions_Analysis.ipynb.

Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and interactive dashboard.

## Dependencies
pandas

plotly

matplotlib

seaborn

## Insights
Global CO2 emissions have generally increased over the years.

The top emitters include [insert top countries based on your analysis].

Some countries show a decline in recent years, likely due to policy changes and technological advancements.

## Future Work
Extend the analysis to include CO2 emissions per capita for a more nuanced view.

Update the dataset with the latest available data for more current insights.

Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast future emissions trends.

Enhance the dashboard with more interactive features like dropdowns and filters.
